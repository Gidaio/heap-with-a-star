# TypeScript Heap With A*ish Pathfinding Algorithm

This project was inspired both by my [hackathon](https://github.com/Gidaio/hackathon)
and by a [pathfinding code challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/6vi9ro/170823_challenge_328_intermediate_pyramid_sliding/).
I knew heaps were used to optimize it, so I went to the Wikipedia page and worked it out!

Time improvements over sorting an array each iteration were significant; upwards of 90% speed increase on my laptop.

I purposefully tried to write it so it could be implemented in many different ways, including (but not limited to) a min heap or a max heap.
